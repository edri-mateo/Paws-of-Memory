## Description:
Computer Science Project

An interactive story game that follows a cat finding its way back home above rooftops by collecting memory orbs, avoiding broken roof tiles, finding first-aid kits when injured, and avoiding jumping too high. The game is completed with animations, music, and sound effects.

## Project Details
**PROJECT TITLE:** Paws of Memory

**PURPOSE OF PROJECT:** A story game of a cat who got lost during a storm and
must remember their way home by collecting memory orbs and avoiding dangers.

**VERSION or DATE:** June 13, 2022

**HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:** Click "run".

**AUTHORS:** Edrielle Mateo

**USER INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Click the space bar to jump
- Jumping is used to collect memory orbs, first aid kits, and to avoid falling through missing roof tiles
- Falling through roof tiles will injure you and your health will go down by 1
- Getting first aid kits will heal you by 1
- Falling until your health bar reaches 0 will result in death by your injuries
- Jumping too high will result in death by an unsuccessful attempt at landing on your feet, you jumped too high
- Falling will also make you forget all your memories and any memory orbs that were collected will be lost
- Gathering 20 memory orbs will restore your memory fully and will allow you to find your way home, and win the game

**GAME PREMISE:**
You play as a cat who got separated from home and cannot remember how to get back. Your goal is to remember your way back home through each memory orb you collect on your journey. 
The journey, however, will not be easy as there will be obstacles along the way: broken roof tiles made by the storm. Falling into one of these will injure you, and could even kill you. 
When you've gathered enough memory orbs, you'll have found your way home... good luck.

**TIER 2 REQUIREMENTS:**
- Keeps track of number of memory orbs collected and displays it on screen for player to see
- Cat jumps when space bar is clicked
- Cat falls when it hits a broken roof tile
- Scrolling background and moving objects (birds move at random different speeds)
- First aid kits added a percentage of time which increase health
 
**TIER 3 REQUIREMENTS:**
- Orbs class constructor takes int parameters that indicates which orb will show up
- HeartBar class constructor takes int parameters that indicated which bar image will show up
- Beginning screen's transparency changes as it fades away 
- Cat uses animations upon arrival into screen using arrays
- Cat uses animations while walking using arrays
- Birds placed at random have flapping/moving animations using arrays

I believe I applied a vast amount of the things that we learnt in class to my project and even went out to learn other things, through the videos given to us but had not covered together as a 
class, and applied it into my own project in a way that was creative and communicative, this includes the jumping, and fading. I was able to identify and solve any possible inconveniences in my 
project and considered how the user would play it and adjusted and improved it to work for the user both communicatively and engagingly. Perhaps I could have found more ways to improve my code to 
be more efficient. I focused a lot on the communication aspect of my project as user experience is definitely important as well. I ensured that instructions and context was given to the user. 
I also provided detailed methods that are organized and informative to communicate easily to other coders. I make sure that my method names make sense whose purposes are easy to recognize by coders.
